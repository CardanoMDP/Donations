Our donations are in the form of goods instead of cash - we actually buy things institutions need and send them over.

That is to avoid wasting funds in "administrative costs" that many organizations suck up - some take 80% of all donated money and only 20% is used if that.

To avoid this we convert ADA to USD, then we contact institutions asking what they need the most, then we make an order (usually with a supermarket) who then delivers everything  and finally we use transferwise to pay the supermarket.

Doing this we are also able to get discounts and buy more stuff to help more.

I'm submitting my proofs (receipts, exchanged e-mails, etc) anyway. Hopefully this will be accepted.
