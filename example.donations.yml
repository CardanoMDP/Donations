#   - Frequency: all donation entries are single donations. If you donate 
#                monthly to a charity you will have to add new entries here on
#                a monthly basis.

- ticker: TICKR
  # ^ No POOL ID!??? Yes, the alliance would not allow duplicate tickers anyway
  #                  and we can always pull the pool ID from the membership 
  #                  JSONs history. Use upper case letters for the ticker.
